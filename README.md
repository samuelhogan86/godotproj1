I've never made a game before. On my christmas break between college semesters, I'm hoping to tackle this challenge!

Important info will be listed here in the future.
--------------------
12/18/24 - decided that as my first project, I'll try to recreate the first 10 or so screens from the metroid nes game.

--------------------
12/29/24 - been very busy for the holidays but had some time to get to work today. I learned how to use Gimp and bimp, a plugin
for gimp that lets me edit multiple images at once. I'm using samuses (samusi?) from a spritesheet but had to remove backgrounds. 
Now, I've successfully gotten my samus into different animations (check it out: https://streamable.com/57jez8)  and also laid the
groundwork for my tileset.
